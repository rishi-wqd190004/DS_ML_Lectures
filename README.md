# DS_ML_Lectures
Here you will find jupyter notebooks and python scripts talking about Data Science and Machine learning sessions

### Here one can refer to Weekly Lecture with the serial order for understanding basic of Python, data analysis, visualization and machine learning.

 ### Some algorithms for Statistical models for classification:
 - Naive Bayes (NB)
 - Stochastic Grdient Dissent (SGD)
 - K-Nearest Neighbors
 - Decsision Trees
 - Random Forest
 - Support Vector Machines(SVM)

 ### Feature Selection

 - Supervised:
    - Intrinsic:
        - Combining below two together
    - Wrapper Method:
        - Split dataset into subsets and train a model using this, based on the output of the model then add or subtract features and train the model again
        - Eg: Forward Selection
    - Filter Method:
        - Features dropped based on their relation to output or how they are correlating to output.
        - Eg: Information Gain, Chi-Square Test, Fisher's score
- Unsupervised
